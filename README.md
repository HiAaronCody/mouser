A Simple Mouse-tracking demo for Paper.js


This is based off the app IOGraphica (http://iographica.com/) which tracks mouse movements on OSX. This is a web implementation that creates similar lines and circles based off user mouse-movement. 

Primarily created for a talk on the HTML5 canvas element, this demo is very simple, but shows the power of paper.js to get up and running to create graphics. In index.html, you'll see a full-screen mouse-tracker. In overlay.html you'll find a mouse-tracker that overlays an iframe.
